* Fortran code for 2D shallow water from Kampf's text.
* Self-contained, no additional input files needed.


BUILD
-----

* I've written a little perl build script, as I wanted to do some profiling experiments. 
For help: 	./build.pl -h
Build and run:	./build.pl -r 

* Or, without using the script, for a simple build, the following should work:
gfortran -c param.f95 sub.f95
gfortran -o run.exe main.f95 param.o sub.o
./run.exe
